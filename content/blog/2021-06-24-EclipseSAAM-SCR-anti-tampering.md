The [DIAS project](https://www.dias-project.com) used Eclipse KUKSA to detect tampering in the exhaust cleaning system of a modern truck.
Modern internal combustion engines have several advanced exhaust treatment systems to meet emission standards and legislation. In case of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for diesel engines, a catalyst (“AdBlue®”) is used as consumable. This incurs costs for the operator of diesel vehicles and provides an incentive to unlawfully circumvent those systems. 

The talk presents how the Eclipse KUKSA stack has been used to realize an anti-tampering system for commercial heavy-duty trucks exhaust systems. It has been presented as part of the [Eclipse SAAM Mobility 2021](https://events.eclipse.org/2021/saam-mobility/) conference and  received the Eclipse SAAM Best Paper Award.
